# This is my context router localStorage state test app

I will keep updating it and hosting a pinned versions at this link:

Open [https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dhsujhbmkw6qs58wzjoo0u7vlpvgxlskuqcq3y8uoijvzajt2v4/](https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dhsujhbmkw6qs58wzjoo0u7vlpvgxlskuqcq3y8uoijvzajt2v4/) to view it in your browser

however, as I learn proper IPFS control my local node may end up down for a bit. That site is hosted
using an IPNS link to the content. I am not sure how to properly pin ipns content where I can take
my node offline and it persists. I do know I can pin this type of static content on the
latest ipfs hash so here is the latest build version:

`QmZvmBYZeTVWmkGbf58f99hRQHHkN6csBwioJbCxNLDyjy` (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZvmBYZeTVWmkGbf58f99hRQHHkN6csBwioJbCxNLDyjy)

this is compiled using the latest push to the `add-components` branch

# you can ignore some of the stuff below and just use yarn build yarn start
